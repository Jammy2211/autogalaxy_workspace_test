"""
W Tilde Preload
===========================

Uses numba (which cannot run alongside JAX in a JAX environment) to preload the w_tilde array, which is used in the
`func_grad_manual.py` script.

"""
__Mask__

We define the ‘real_space_mask’ which defines the grid the image the galaxy is evaluated using.
"""
real_space_mask = ag.Mask2D.circular(
    shape_native=(128, 128),
    pixel_scales=(0.03625, 0.03625),
    radius=3.0,
)

"""
__Dataset__

Load and plot the galaxy `Interferometer` dataset `simple__sersic` from .fits files, which we will fit 
with the model.

This includes the method used to Fourier transform the real-space image of the galaxy to the uv-plane and compare 
directly to the visibilities. We use a non-uniform fast Fourier transform, which is the most efficient method for 
interferometer datasets containing ~1-10 million visibilities. We will discuss how the calculation of the likelihood
function changes for different methods of Fourier transforming in this guide.

dataset_path = path.join("dataset", "interferometer", dataset_name)

dataset = ag.Interferometer.from_fits(
    data_path=path.join(dataset_path, "data.fits"),
    noise_map_path=path.join(dataset_path, "noise_map.fits"),
    uv_wavelengths_path=path.join(dataset_path, "uv_wavelengths.fits"),

)

"""
__Mask__

This function, which creates the 2D mask, is the first function we will target speeding up.

Currently, with JAX, the code below runs fine. This is because when the USE_JAX enviroment variable is 1,
numba is disabled and the function runs as normal.

However, it will be significantly slower than normal because numba is disabled, and it is impleneted
in a slow way (see below).

    """
    The matrix w_tilde is a matrix of dimensions [image_pixels, image_pixels] that encodes the NUFFT of every pair of
    image pixels given the noise map. This can be used to efficiently compute the curvature matrix via the mappings
    between image and source pixels, in a way that omits having to perform the NUFFT on every individual source pixel.
    This provides a significant speed up for inversions of interferometer datasets with large number of visibilities.

    The limitation of this matrix is that the dimensions of [image_pixels, image_pixels] can exceed many 10s of GB's,
    making it impossible to store in memory and its use in linear algebra calculations extremely. The method
    `w_tilde_preload_interferometer_from` describes a compressed representation that overcomes this hurdles. It is
    advised `w_tilde` and this method are only used for testing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    noise_map_real
        The real noise-map values of the interferometer data.
    uv_wavelengths
        The wavelengths of the coordinates in the uv-plane for the interferometer dataset that is to be Fourier
        transformed.
    grid_radians_slim
        The 1D (y,x) grid of coordinates in radians corresponding to real-space mask within which the image that is
        Fourier transformed is computed.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        A matrix that encodes the NUFFT values between the noise map that enables efficient calculation of the curvature
        matrix.
