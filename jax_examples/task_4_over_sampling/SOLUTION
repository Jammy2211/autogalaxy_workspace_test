Only support single `sub_size` adaptive grid (e.g. all 4s or adaptive), BUT A USER HAS TO SET THIS UP, removing:

- Automatic generation of adaptive grids via light model / profile centers.
- Decorators in Tracer with crazy plane over sampling.
- Remove complex config and just default to 32, 4, 1.

Documentation in workspace should make it clear a user has to choose over sampling, especially for multi galaxy
examples.

Simulator scripts will need especially clear documentation and good methods for this, especially for strong lenses.


Make adaptive one day.
